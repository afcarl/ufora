Setting up a Cluster on a Local Network
=======================================

Before You Begin
----------------

This tutorial walks you through installing the pyfora backend on a cluster of machines.
If you have not read through the :doc:`/tutorials/onebox` tutorial yet, it is recommended that you
familiarize yourself with it before continuing with the multi-machine setup.


pyfora Cluster Topology
-----------------------

A pyfora cluster consists of a single *manager* and one or more *workers*.
Workers contribute CPU and memory resources to the cluster and are where all computations take place.
Workers connect to the manager and register themselves with it.
They use the manager to discover each other's network addresses and port configuration and to find
out when new workers join the cluster.

The manager, in addition to acting as a registry of workers, also acts as the cluster's front end.
Client machines that use the pyfora package to submit computations to a cluster only ever talks
to the cluster's manager. Workers only communicate with each other and with their manager.
The pyfora package connects to the manager over HTTP using socket.io_ to support real-time
notifications from the cluster.

.. _socket.io: http://socket.io/


The Backend Docker Image
------------------------

In the :doc:`/tutorials/onebox` tutorial you used the ``ufora/service`` docker image to start a container
that ran both the manager and a worker on your local machine.
The same image can be configured to run a worker that connects to a specified manager or, optionally,
run the manager without a worker.


Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several environment variable that can be set when launching a pyfora container to configure its behavior.

* :envvar:`UFORA_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: the host-name or IP address of the manager.
  Setting this variable causes the container to only run the worker service.
  Without this variable, the container runs both manager and worker services.

* :envvar:`UFORA_WORKER_OWN_ADDRESS`: the host-name or IP address that the worker uses to register
  itself with the manager. The manager and other workers try to connect to it using this address.
  This is useful in situations where you have multiple network interfaces (public and private,
  or a docker container running in bridge mode) and you want to tell the worker which address to register.
  The variable is required unless the worker container is started with the ``--net=host`` option,
  in which case the worker tries to figure out its own address using
  ``socket.gethostbyname(socket.getfqdn())`` if the variable isn't set.

* :envvar:`UFORA_WORKER_BASE_PORT`: the first of two consecutive ports that the worker listens on.
  This is useful if you want to run multiple workers side-by-side.

* :envvar:`UFORA_NO_WORKER`: Set this variable to 1 to prevent the manager container from also running a worker.
  This variable and :envvar:`UFORA_MANAGER_ADDRESS` are mutually exclusive. At most one of them can be set.

* :envvar:`UFORA_WEB_HTTP_PORT`: the port used by the manager's HTTP server.


Ports
^^^^^

Worker Ports
""""""""""""

pyfora workers communicate with each other over two consecutively numbered ports.
One port is used to maintain a control channel over which they coordinate work,
and the other is used as a data channel where large chunks of data can be transmitted.

The default ports are: ``30009`` and ``30010``.

They can be configured using the :envvar:`UFORA_WORKER_BASE_PORT` environment variable.


Manager Ports
"""""""""""""

The manager listens on two ports. One is the worker registry service to which workers connect,
and the other is the HTTP server that clients connect to using the pyfora package.

The worker registry port is 30002 and is not currently configurable. A configuration option will be added in a future release.
This port only needs to be accessible to workers.

The default HTTP port is ``30000`` and is configured using the :envvar:`UFORA_WEB_HTTP_PORT` environment variable.


Security
""""""""

If you run the cluster on a local, trusted network you may not need to worry about this and can skip to the next section.
If, however, you run your cluster in the cloud or a shared network, you may want to read on.

The pyfora services do not have any build-in authentication mechanisms.
There is no notion of accounts, credentials, logging-in, etc.  If you have network access to the services, you can submit work.
It is therefore recommended that you configure firewall rules (or a security group on AWS) such that only
machines in the cluster can connect to your workers on their ports (``30009``, and ``30010`` by default),
and to your manager on the worker-registry port (``30002``).

To connect your pyfora client in a secure way, it is recommended that you tunnel your HTTP traffic
over SSH using the ``-L port:host:hostport`` option.
For example, if your manager is running at ``54.144.209.248`` you can map your local port ``30000``
to the same port on the manager using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh user_name@54.144.209.248 -L 30000:localhost:30000

Now as long as your SSH session is open, you can connect to the manager using ``localhost:30000``.


Running the Service
-------------------

The instructions below assume you have already installed docker and pulled the ``ufora/service`` image
on all machines in the cluster.

While not strictly necessary, it is recommended that you create a directory on all your machines which
will be mounted to ``/var/ufora`` on all your pyfora containers. The pyfora services will write their logs into it,
and having it on the host machine can make accessing logs easier.
The instructions below assume this directory is ``/home/user/ufora``, replace it with your own path when running the commands.


The Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^

Pick a machine to run the manager service and run the following command to start the manager and a worker on it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo docker run -d --name pyfora_manager -p 30000:30000 -p 30002:30002 -v /home/user/ufora:/var/ufora ufora/service


To run the manager service without a worker run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo docker run -d --name pyfora_manager -e UFORA_NO_WORKER=1 -p 30000:30000 -p 30002:30002 -v /home/user/ufora:/var/ufora ufora/service


Workers
^^^^^^^

If your manager is running, for example, at ``192.168.1.15``, and the worker is at ``192.168.2.11``, start a worker using:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo docker run -d --name pyfora_worker -e UFORA_MANAGER_ADDRESS=192.168.1.15 -e UFORA_WORKER_OWN_ADDRESS=192.168.2.11 -p 30009:30009 -p 30010:30010 -v /home/user/ufora:/var/ufora ufora/service

Repeat this on every machine you want to use as a worker in your cluster.


Verify
------

You can now verify that pyfora is able to connect to the manager and run computations.
Create a local file called ``testpyfora.py`` with the following conent::

    import pyfora, math

    executor = pyfora.connect('http://<your_manager_address>:30000')
    with executor.remotely.donwloadAll():
        x = sum(math.sin(i) for i in xrange(10**9))

    print x


Run it from your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python testpyfora.py
    -0.124548962703


This may be a good point to jump over to the :doc:`/tutorials/intro` tutorial and learn more about
coding with pyfora.

# What is Ufora?

Ufora is the creator of `pyfora` - a compiled, automatically parallel subset of python for data science
and numerical computing.

Any code you run with `pyfora` will work unmodified in python. But with `pyfora`,
it can run hundreds or thousands of times faster, and can operate
on datasets many times larger than the RAM of a single machine.

# How do I get started?

Visit the [pyfora documentation](http://docs.pyfora.com/) for examples, setup guides, and library reference.
